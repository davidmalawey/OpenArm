# OpenArm
_An open-source robot arm_

I am starting a design for a robot arm and invite the open community to collaborate on this.  

## Characteristics:

* 3D Printable + OTS
* Modular - multi DOF
* Parametric - change the size as you wish
* VERY affordable
* Using DC motors, M2 Belts, and M2 pulleys like those of 3D printers
* having no
* bio-inspired - having damping forces and torque stack additively along joints.
* Digital Twin - the simulated design will represent the real implementation sufficiently to simulate
* interchangeable motors & pulleys - the design leaves space internally for changes.

## AI performance
Instead of encoders and highly precise motion at every joint, this arm is intended to control the end-effector like a person controls their hands.  We have a general sense of our elbow location but we don't perform fine control of the elbow to position the hands finely.  

Kinematics will not be easy as the motors, back-EMF, etc will cross-influence one joint to another.  Instead, the bot is intended to evolve its performance through AI training (simulated and real-world).

# Build & Design Log

## Getting Started
This deisgn will take a long time as it's not my priority project.  Collaboration is welcome.  Editing this repository is welcome.  Sharing comments & intellectual additions are encouraged by all.
